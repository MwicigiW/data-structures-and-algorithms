What are data structures and algorithms?
  - Data structure = systematic way of organizing and accessing data
  - Algorithm = step-by-step procedure for performing some task in a finite amount of time. 
  
To analyze how "good" these things are, we use running time and space, since both are precious resources.

Since various factors affect runtime (CPU power, temperature, etc.) we use the relative running time O(n), 
with n being the number of inputs.

For simplicity, we will always assume worst-case time.

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```
